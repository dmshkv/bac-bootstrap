##  Backbone_Almond_Compass_Boilerplate
===================================
What is it?

Lightweight Boilerplate to start front-end application.

Simple Backbone application with configured infrastucture.

1. We have backbone project based on require js
2. SASS+COMPASS to manage css
3. JST to precompile lodash.js(underscore.js) templates
4. Grunt.js with configured JST and SASS watchers.
5. Grunt.js with a task configured:
	- to minify final css 
    - to compile templates to JST 
    - to build all javascript files to single one due to Almond.js 
    
I included not important dependencies to show how include them into backbone views.
For example, jquery ui and datepicker may be removed from boilerplate.
